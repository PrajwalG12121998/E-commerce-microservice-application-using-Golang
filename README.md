# E-commerce Microservice Application using Golang

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **e-commerce microservice architecture** built with **Golang**.  
It demonstrates how multiple services can interact using **gRPC**, with a **GraphQL gateway** aggregating data from all services.

### Services
- **Account Service** – manages user accounts.
- **Catalog Service** – manages products.
- **Order Service** – manages orders and coordinates with Account & Catalog services.
- **GraphQL Gateway** – single entry point for clients to interact with all services.
- **PostgreSQL** – used by Account and Order services for persistence.
- **Elasticsearch** – used by Catalog service for product search.
